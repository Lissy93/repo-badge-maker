## About
I made this to quickly generate the project links, for this post: [CLI tools you won't be able to live without üîß ](https://dev.to/lissy93/cli-tools-you-cant-live-without-57f6)

Just a simple script to quickly generate embedable markdown badges to show repository info.<br>
Data is fetched from the GitHub API, and badges are served up using the <a href="https://shields.io/">Shields.io</a> API.<br>
Includes a badge for + link to: the author, the repo + star count, and the language used.<br>
Paste in the URL to a repo, hit 'Generate', and results will be copied to your clipboard.

## Deployment
It's just a static HTML page, so serve it with any web server, CDN or static host.<br>
There's a demo hosted on GH Pages, at: [lissy93.github.io/repo-badge-maker](https://lissy93.github.io/repo-badge-maker/)
